Interested in computers since I was a kid, I learned to code very early thanks to lego robots. With a lot of online stores or even showcase sites that I made for friends I could know the basics of web development.

I quickly learned cybersecurity with sites like <a target="_blank" href="https://hackthebox.com">HackTheBox</a>
or <a target="_blank" href="https://vulnhub.com">vulnHub</a>. I wish to work in cybersecurity later on.

In spite of this passion I am very sportive, I practiced handball for 7 years, I also travelled a lot which allowed me to improve my eloquence and my capacity to negotiate.
